									<p style="font-size: 1.1em;">Two Worlds is a 2-D isometric puzzle game where you have to get the cube from start to finish.
										The game currently consists of 9 short levels that start out simple and get more complicated as you progress.<br><br>

										This is my first game that I had started working on in Unity and it was used primarily to get used to the whole framework 
										and workflow. I initially had thought that the development of the project would be relatively simple but there was a 
										lot of issues regarding sprite sorting among other things that extended the estimated finish date by a decent margin. However, 
										as eager as I was on my first project, it was definitely a great learning experience as I was developing my knowledge with working 
										with Unity and turned out to be a relaxing little puzzle game.<br><br>
										The initial idea for the puzzle game came when I was watching one of my favorite game dev youtubers for pixel art and saw he had 
										made a video on isometric pixel art tiles. Since the project itself was more of a learning process for myself rather than making 
										an actual game, I had thought that I would do a simple yet unique puzzle game that consisted of two worlds: one world has the player 
										where he/she can move around in and the other world has statues that can alter the main world's tiles. This along with the 
										isometric pixel art style was something that I found very pleasant to design. The original thought process was to make the game for the mobile platform which is actually why the game is played only using the 
										mouse. However, since the project was just a learning experience, I decided to just leave it as a very short PC game.<br><br>
										The game has:
										<ul style="margin-top: -30px;font-size: 1.1em;">
											<li>9 different levels of varying difficulty</li>
											<li>Click-only gameplay so only a mouse is needed</li>
											<li>Pause menu functionality so players can quit the level, mute sound or mute music</li>
											<li>A save and load system so players can start at the level they left off</li>
											<li>2-D animated pixel sprites and tiles all created using Aseprite</li>
											<li>A title soundtrack and a main game sound track composed in FL Studio 20</li>
											<li>Same tune used for both worlds but played differently to emulate the feeling of different worlds</li>
											<li>A tutorial system</li>
										</ul>

										of gravity to move up or down.<br><br>

									<p style="font-size: 1.1em;">
										Although I already have some experience with 3D, this game effectively serves as my true introduction into Unity 3-D. 
										With that being said, I wanted to make something that was simple and easy to understand, and also playable whenever, so 
										I opted to make this game for the mobile platform. The game itself is a simple concept, a ball (the player) travels from left 
										to right, and gravity will make it fall downward or upward depending on if the player taps and holds the screen or not. This 
										idea of taking a simple concept and making it good rather than trying to do many things at once is something I am focusing on 
										for this game.<br><br> 
										Since the overall game idea is simple, I wanted to take the chance to learn more intermediate level coding concepts with this 
										project such as interfaces and events. This would help solidify my understanding of object-oriented programming methodologies 
										and use them in a way that makes my code modular and usable for future applications. I also decided to practice using Unity's 
										shader graph to ease myself into rendering effects rather than learning the code directly. One particular art style that I 
										like is toon/cel-shading where the characters and environment take on more of a cartoon-ish anime look. I decided to attempt 
										that kind of style in my game because I wanted to explore the concept and learn how it works considering I would try and 
										use it at some point in the future.<br><br>

										The game currently has:
										<ul style="margin-top: -30px;font-size: 1.1em;">
											<li>Score tracker based on distance</li>
											<li>Basic toon shader applied to all materials</li>
											<li>Color selector for customizability</li>
											<li>Randomly generated obstacles with random properties such as floating and moving</li>
											<li>Stamina system where the game ends if stamina runs out</li>
											<li>Increasing difficulty where frequency of obstacles goes up</li>
											<li>Save system that stores information on what skin was set on start-up</li>
										</ul>

									<p style="font-size: 1.1em;">
										The game jam that this game was made and submitted for was the first game jam I had ever done. With the given time frame 
										of about 72 hours, I felt that it would be a good chance to use some more of the tools that Unity had to offer which 
										included the in-built lighting system. I had joined this game jam shortly after I had started working on 
										<a href="#" onclick="ToProject('JadeRoom','TwoWorlds')">Two Worlds</a> which allowed me to explore in-depth sprite sheet 
										implementation, sprite animations and camera movements.<br><br> 
										The idea in itself is not very unique since it is just a very generic 2-D platformer with a partially amusing storyline. 
										You play as a character who attempts to steal a jade from a temple, but with each attempt more obstacles/enemies appear. 
										The dialogue in the game shows your character communicating with your boss/leader who likes to joke around and makes sure 
										that you are doing your job.<br><br> 
										I mainly saw this game as a means of coming up with an idea for a project and finishing it. 
										Given that my initial ideas for the game involved having 5 levels with much more difficult platforming, I think that this 
										helped me understand and shrink my scope so that I could at least finish something. That is what I think game jams are 
										all about, putting a finished game product out there. My whole first experience of a game jam sums up what I believe 
										to be the importance of making any game, which is to understand the scope and design of your game and finishing/putting 
										something out there no matter what.<br><br>

										The game has:
										<ul style="margin-top: -30px;font-size: 1.1em;">

									<p style="font-size: 1.1em;">
										You play as a delivery person whose job is to grab packages dropped from buildings/houses and deliver them to their respective 
										locations along with a stamina bar 'time limit'. Compared to what I would usually go for in a game jam, this was a step in a 
										different direction. My focus this time was to refine a simple game concept to something that had more replayability.<br><br>
										There were many things I have taken from after the game jam had ended along with all the feedback I had received. The game's 
										highest rating amongst other criteria were its art and graphical design which I had hoped to be its gameplay mechanics, but 
										after reviewing all the feedback and taking another look at the game from a less 'time-crunched' mindset, I definitely did see 
										all the shortcomings the game had.<br><br>
										The game itself was made to be too difficult as destinations for packages would disappear 
										for added difficulty so you would have to remember which building it went to. Although in the game description, it was not 
										apparent at a glance that you had to deliver packages from left to right which I felt I could have made more clear. Last but 
										not least, the collisions between the player and buildings is quite clunky. When you go at an angle into a building 
										or fencing, you just stop instead of slide along the collider. Regardless of all of this, it was a great learning experience 
										and I believe that I had gotten better at realizing the scope of a game and putting a finished product out there, because this 
										was the first time the finished game had come close to what I had anticipated at the start of the jam.<br><br>

									<p style="font-size: 1.1em;">Smog is a 2-D pixel art story game made for game jam Ludum Dare 50. The game is a visual novel 
										style game about a kid and his guardian who live in a village where they must take shelter from a deadly smog. <br><br>

									</p>
									<div class="section-break"></div>
									<p style="font-size: 1.1em;">
										You play as both the kid and his guardian in different parts of the story. Drawing inspiration from action-adventure story 
										heavy games like Heavy Rain and Detroit Become Human, the experience is interactive and has quick actions so that the player 
										must react to press the correct keys within a time limit. <br><br>
										For this game jam specifically, I had wanted to try something completely different than what I was used to. Something that would 
										push my creative boundaries. The theme for the game jam was 'Delay the Inevitable', which directly invites some sort of 
										survival/high-score based game. This was the direction I had thought of going initially, because it was the most obvious. However,
										to learn something new, I took it a completely different direction and went more story heavy.<br><br>
										Multiple issues arose during the making of the game. I was not too familiar with some of the built-in features of Unity and 
										its cutscene making system 'Timelines', so I had ended up making all cutscenes in a script. This ultimately resulted in me 
										writing a lot of spaghetti code and made it inconvenient to debug. Also, my scope of the game was way too large, so there were 
										many features of the game I had to cut simply because I did not have enough time to implement them. I had already anticipated that 
										the technical/gameplay aspect would be quite low as many visual novel/story games are a simple 'press (insert button here) to 
										continue', so I really tried my best to emphasize the artistic style and ambience of the game. Coming to the results, they were 
										definitely a lot better than I would have anticipated. Landing in the top 12% for audio and graphics and the top 2% for mood, 
										I was more than happy with what I had accomplished, but there are definitely still many things to learn from the feedback that I 
										got and simply looking at the game afterwards.<br><br>

										The game has:
										<ul style="margin-top: -30px;font-size: 1.1em;">
											<li>Immersive story</li>
											<li>Short quick-action sequence</li>
											<li>2-D pixel sprites and animations all created using Aseprite</li>
											<li>Three short sound tracks composed on piano and record in FL Studio 20</li>
