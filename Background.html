											My name is Matthew Quach but I go by the username (PK)Zinpo not only when I play games, but also when I develop projects 
											for game jams or submission to itch.io. I went to college at the University of Oklahoma and initially started out working 
											toward a mechanical engineering degree. At the time of my freshman year, I had already been playing games, but it never 
											crossed my mind that I would ever want to be the one developing games. Working hard through my first year, it was not until 
											I took a required intro to programming course in the first semester of my sophomore year when I thought "Hey, it would be 
											pretty awesome to make my own game." What first started out as some quirky project ideas, a final for my programming course, 
											and a hobby to do in my free time, later turned out to be what I wanted to take on as a career.<br><br>
											There was no real game development program or club in my university so I could only learn through self-teachings and watching 
											videos online. Even though my university did offer a computer science program, I simply stuck to my mechanical engineering degree 
											and just did game development on the side. Just like how all new game developers start, I started with working toward a 2-D 
											platformer using the GameMaker Studio 2 engine. However, I figured that I would rather switch to a more well-known engine 
											because I thought it would be better for me in the future. So I switched to Unity which was overwhelming at first, but I 
											adapted quickly and everything just seemed make sense the more I did it. I then started to make 
											my first puzzle game 
											where developed everything myself from top to bottom which is something I pride myself in. Amidst my craze for developing and 
											learning, I joined two game jams, one of which being Ludum Dare which is one of the most known. Until now, I have been working 
											hard to develop my skill set and learn even more things.

											Although I am working to be mainly a "game developer/engineer", as I have been working on my games solo, I have also made pixel 
											art sprites/animations, composed tracks, level designed for my puzzle game, and, in all of my games, I try my best to make 
											the UI appealling and cohesive with the game itself. A "jack-of-all-trades" as people would call it. Though I specialize in 
											the actual programming and development of games, I find myself to want to learn everything about game development so I do have 
											some acknowledgable skills in music composition, UI design, pixel art drawing/animations, and game design (self-proclaimed of 
											course).<br><br>

											<p style="margin-bottom: 1%;margin-top:1%"><strong>What I hope to accomplish</strong></p>
										</header>
										<p style="font-size: 1.1em;">
											Ever since I started doing game development as a hobby, I have always had a goal to make my own dream game. Of course, that 
											is something that all passionate game developers want, making the game of their dreams. So since my college days, ideas and 
											concepts were always brewing up and kept on the back burner since the scope of it would have been way too large for a starting 
											project. As a result, I have been constantly working on projects, learning new skills and working toward the point where I 
											could start working on the game of my dreams, and this game would not just be me pitching some random idea to some game studio 
											or working with some large company to make a game. This would be a project that would be very close to me. So in the future, 
											what I hope to do is that I conjure up all of my skills in game development that I acquired over the years and create something 
											that is representative of what I have learned and accomplished, and share it with the world in what I envision to be the game 
											of my dreams. But, of course, baby steps first.<br><br>
